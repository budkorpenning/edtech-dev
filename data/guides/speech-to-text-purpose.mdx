# AI Speech-to-Text Web App: Purpose and Prerequisites

In this guide, we'll explore the purpose and prerequisites for building an AI-powered speech-to-text web application that runs locally on your computer. This project leverages open-source AI technology to create a practical tool for transcribing spoken audio.

## Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a web application that:

1. Captures audio from your computer's microphone
2. Processes that audio using OpenAI's Whisper model running locally
3. Returns accurate text transcriptions in real-time
4. Runs completely on your local machine (no data sent to external servers)
5. Provides a simple, user-friendly interface

This application allows you to transcribe spoken language into text without relying on cloud-based services, ensuring your data remains private and accessible even without an internet connection.

## The Model: Whisper

For this project, we'll be using Whisper, an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI. Key features include:

- Open-source and freely available
- Trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask data
- Supports transcription in multiple languages
- Capable of translating speech into English
- Can run efficiently on consumer hardware

We'll be using a smaller version of the model that balances accuracy with performance to ensure it runs well on standard hardware.

## Technical Prerequisites

To complete this project, you should have:

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic to intermediate Python programming skills
- Familiarity with web concepts (HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics)
- Understanding of virtual environments in Python
- Basic command line/terminal skills

### Hardware Prerequisites
- Computer with at least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended)
- At least 2GB of free disk space
- A working microphone
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system

### Software Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer installed
- Git (for downloading project files)
- Internet connection (for initial setup only)

## Development Tools

We'll be using the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: Our primary programming language
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for Python
- **Whisper**: OpenAI's speech recognition model
- **PyAudio**: For capturing audio from your microphone
- **AJAX/JavaScript**: For making the web interface interactive
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the web interface

## Skill Level and Time Commitment

This project is appropriate for intermediate Python developers who have some experience with web development concepts. While we'll provide detailed explanations for each step, having a foundation in Python programming will make the process smoother.

Expected time to complete:
- Setup and installation: 30-60 minutes
- Development: 2-3 hours
- Testing and refinement: 1 hour

By the end of this project, you'll have a functional speech-to-text web application that runs entirely on your local machine, providing accurate transcriptions without requiring an internet connection or sending your data to third-party servers.

In the next guide, we'll set up our development environment and install all necessary dependencies to get started building our application.
