# How to Install Ubuntu on a PC

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Ubuntu on your PC, from preparation to post-installation configuration.

## Prerequisites

- A PC with at least 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
- 25GB of free disk space (more recommended)
- A USB drive with at least 4GB capacity
- Backup of important data from your current system

## Step 1: Prepare for Installation

### Backup Your Data

Before proceeding, back up all important data from your current operating system.

### Download Ubuntu

1. Visit the [official Ubuntu website](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
2. Download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Ubuntu Desktop

### Create a Bootable USB Drive

1. On Windows:

   - Download and install [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)
   - Insert your USB drive
   - Open Rufus, select your USB drive and the Ubuntu ISO file
   - Click "Start" and select "Write in ISO image mode"

2. On macOS:

   - Install Etcher from [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
   - Open Etcher
   - Select the Ubuntu ISO file and your USB drive
   - Click "Flash!"

3. On Linux:
   - Install Etcher or use the `dd` command:
   ```bash
   sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/ubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress oflag=sync
   ```
   (Replace `/dev/sdX` with your USB drive, be careful to select the correct drive!)

## Step 2: Configure BIOS/UEFI Settings

1. Restart your computer and enter the BIOS/UEFI setup (usually by pressing F2, F12, Delete, or Esc during boot)
2. Disable Secure Boot if enabled
3. Set the boot mode to UEFI and Legacy (or "Both") if you have the option
4. Save changes and exit

## Step 3: Boot from the USB Drive

1. With the USB drive plugged in, restart your computer
2. Access the boot menu (usually by pressing F12, Esc, or F2 during startup)
3. Select the USB drive from the boot menu
4. When the Ubuntu boot menu appears, select "Try or Install Ubuntu"

## Step 4: Install Ubuntu

1. Once Ubuntu loads, click on "Install Ubuntu"
2. Select your language and click "Continue"
3. Choose "Normal installation" and select if you want to:
   - Download updates while installing
   - Install third-party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware
4. Click "Continue"

### Decide on Installation Type

- **Install alongside existing OS (dual-boot)**: Choose "Install Ubuntu alongside [your current OS]"
- **Replace existing OS**: Choose "Erase disk and install Ubuntu"
- **Custom partitioning**: Choose "Something else"

> **Note**: If you choose to dual-boot, make sure to back up your data first. If you're replacing your current OS, all data will be erased.

5. Follow the prompts to configure your installation (time zone, keyboard layout, etc.)
6. Create a user account:
   - Enter your name
   - Create a computer name
   - Choose a username
   - Set a strong password
7. Click "Continue" to begin the installation
8. Wait for the installation to complete (typically 10-20 minutes)

## Step 5: Reboot and Log In

1. When prompted, remove the USB drive and click "Restart Now"
2. After rebooting, you'll see the login screen
3. Enter your password to log in to your new Ubuntu system

## Step 6: Post-Installation Setup

### Update Your System

1. Open Terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)
2. Run these commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

### Install Additional Drivers

1. Open the "Software & Updates" application
2. Go to the "Additional Drivers" tab
3. Install any recommended drivers, especially for graphics cards
4. Restart your computer if prompted

### Install Essential Software

1. Open Ubuntu Software Center
2. Browse and install applications you need (web browsers, office suite, multimedia tools, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Boot Issues

- If you can't boot into Ubuntu, try disabling Fast Boot in Windows and in BIOS
- Check if Secure Boot is disabled in BIOS/UEFI

### Graphics Issues

- If you experience graphics problems, try booting with the "nomodeset" parameter:
  1. At the GRUB menu, press 'e' to edit
  2. Find the line starting with "linux" and add "nomodeset" at the end
  3. Press F10 to boot

### Wi-Fi Problems

- If Wi-Fi doesn't work, connect via Ethernet if possible
- Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install linux-firmware` to install additional firmware
