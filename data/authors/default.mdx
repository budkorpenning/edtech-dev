EdtechAgent.AI is a solo project born from **20 years** of hands-on experience in education and technology. At its core is a simple belief: powerful educational technology shouldn't be limited by budget constraints. While commercial edtech solutions often come with hefty price tags, EdtechAgent.AI is dedicated to exploring and creating **free, open-source alternatives** that help schools make the most of their limited resources.

Drawing from extensive experience in both **teaching and school leadership**, this initiative bridges the gap between cutting-edge AI and practical classroom reality (spoiler: it's not always pretty, but it's always interesting).

EdtechAgent.AI focuses on staying current with **AI, educational technology, and global trends** - but with a practical twist. Instead of chasing expensive solutions, the focus is on discovering and crafting accessible, open-source alternatives that make sense for real educators. The site specializes in taking complicated tech concepts and turning them into something that makes sense in the real world, which comes in handy when explaining why that new AI tool isn't actually going to replace teachers (but might help them get home before sunset).

This project emerged from years of working as a translator between two worlds - the **fast-paced tech industry** and the **measured pace of education**. Think of EdtechAgent.AI as your friendly neighborhood tech enthusiast, helping schools find and implement smart, budget-conscious solutions that avoid those "well, that seemed like a good idea at the time" moments when it comes to new technology.
