After **20 years** in education and technology, I'd like to think I've gotten pretty good at making them work together. I'm Jörgen Selander, and as a former **teacher and principal**, I've seen firsthand what happens when great ideas meet classroom reality (spoiler: it's not always pretty, but it's always interesting).

These days, I spend my time keeping up with the latest in **AI, educational technology, and global trends** - basically trying to stay one step ahead of the robots while making sure they're actually helping teachers teach and students learn. I have a knack for taking complicated tech stuff and turning it into something that makes sense in the real world, which comes in handy when you're trying to explain why that new AI tool isn't actually going to replace teachers (but might help them get home before sunset).

My journey from classroom to product management has been a bit like being a translator between two worlds - the fast-paced tech industry and the measured pace of education. Think of me as someone who helps schools avoid those "well, that seemed like a good idea at the time" moments when it comes to implementing new technology.
